<li> "Midnights" features artist Lana Del Rey in one of the songs. 
 <li> "Midnights" is Taylor Swift's 10th studio album, released around October 2022.
 <li> It has 13 tracks and 7 additional vault tracks, marking Taylor's return to pop after 2 years of folk music.
 <li> "Midnights" is somehow different from the other albums because it's Taylor doing everything all at once, blending many genres into one. 😎 You could cry in one song and dance to the next.
